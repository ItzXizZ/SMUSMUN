Since attending her first Model United Nations conference, she has learned many lessons. Namely, the necessity for others to wear deodorants (especially when they are sitting next to her for the entire day and are an avid placard raiser), the route to Brandy Melville from the Hyatt Regency and how fast she can sprint there in heels, the number of sugar-free Redbulls to get her through a committee session, and the importance of a good Model UN conference. Recently, Cindy has been scrolling on Pinterest, shopping with friends, growing her Jellycat collection, and brain rotting her USG/chemistry lab partner. As logistical stress increases for her, SMUSMUN’s conference date approaches! Celebrating its five year anniversary since its creation in 2021, Cindy is dedicated to making this conference the best experience for all delegates and cannot wait to see who gets assassinated!",
      "usg": "Ethan is thrilled to be a part of this year’s Model United Nations team! With a passion for diplomacy and problem-solving, he enjoys engaging in discussions about global issues and finding innovative solutions. A dedicated STEM enthusiast, Ethan loves exploring the intersections of science, technology, and policy, always looking for ways to integrate cutting-edge advancements into international affairs. When he’s not debating resolutions, Ethan enjoys watching Miraculous Ladybug and analyzing the clever storytelling and character dynamics of the show. He’s also a huge fan of J.A.R.V.I.S. from Iron Man, admiring the AI’s intelligence, efficiency, and, of course, its iconic voice. Whether he’s tackling real-world challenges or dreaming about futuristic tech, Ethan brings enthusiasm and a strategic mindset to every discussion. He looks forward to an exciting year of collaboration, diplomacy, and making a difference through MUN!",

After opening her eyes to MUN conferences in Grade 7 when participating in VYMUN 2020, Chelsea decided to continue with Model UN and is so grateful for all the learning and skills that her numerous conferences have provided. From discussing whether or not cannibalism is a good option for underdeveloped countries to assassinating the Premier of Saskatchewan, Chelsea enjoys participating in MUN because of the opportunities to make cherished memories, meet new people and gain insight into global issues from different perspectives. Outside of the committee room, Chelsea loves to read books, sing, learn new languages, and be out in nature. She hopes that NATO will be an interesting and enjoyable committee for all involved and that all those involved in SMUSMUN will take away cherished memories.",

After thoroughly enjoying a Global Goals conference in Grade 6, Deristhi decided to make MUN a permanent feature in her school curriculum. Over the last seven years, Deristhi’s MUN journey has opened her eyes to human rights issues, social problems, economic matters, and health crises affecting the world. Outside of the committee room, Deristhi loves playing squash, watching movies, getting lost in a good book, and spending time with her family and friends. She is looking forward to meeting all the delegates, facilitating lively debate, promoting diplomacy, and working on resolutions that make the world a better place.

His deep interest in politics and public policy drives his engagement in parliamentary simulations, where he enjoys tackling complex issues and shaping thoughtful discussions. This year, he is leading the House of Commons Committee and is excited to serve as its Director, guiding debate on key political topics. Beyond his involvement in politics, Liam is active in leadership, investment clubs, and outdoor ledaership, bringing a well-rounded perspective to his work. His commitment to political discourse and global affairs continues to shape his academic and extracurricular pursuits.",
      "c2": "Looking forwards to the start of the conference! House of Commons is a lot more structured than many of you will be used to but you'll have way more fun debating in it. Since I've started with MUN a few years ago (I'm in Grade 12) I can tell you for sure that this is my favorite type of committee due to its intensity and the coalitions you have to make (I'll show you why over the course of the conference)! Please talk to me about whatever questions you have, I am sure that I've asked worst ones before, so don't worry ;).",
      "a2": "Working through his Grade 10 year at St. Michaels University School, Liam is delighted and honoured to serve in the House of Commons. After participating in his first MUN conference in Grade 6, Liam’s interest in world history, politics, and public speaking was sparked. From turning the moon into a corporation that went public, then capturing the majority share through Chinese front companies -- to resolving so many conflicts on amendments, many of Liam's most cherished memories are about MUN. When not sending world-saving/ending directives, Liam can be found sailing, running the SMUS Economics Club and singing karaoke to some of the worst songs ever known. This year at SMUSMUN he hopes to create a fun conference environment with engaging debates.",
      "s2": "Peter is thrilled to staff in the HOC at this year’s SMUSMUN. A Grade 12 student at SMUS, Peter has navigated the world of Model UN since middle school and made numerous fond memories, as both a delegate trying to make the most out of obscure position assignments and a staff member cracking up at creative directive titles. When he’s not busy initiating hypothetical nuclear wars, Peter can be heard jamming on his guitars way too loudly, laughing at his own jokes, or yelling at the TV when a soccer game is on. He looks forward to reconnecting with familiar faces at SMUSMUN 2025, as well as meeting and creating a fun experience for new delegates.",

After 5 years of Model UN, navigating countless ten-second speeches, tardy committee session arrivals, and the exhillerating task of getting to know individuals from all across the globe, Josie has grown to enjoy the rigorous debate and unique experiences MUN has to offer. Beyond diplomatic pursuits, she can be found listening to music (she really does have the best music taste), chatting with anyone who will listen, and frantically submitting an assignment at 11:59 PM. She hopes to make SMUSMUN 2025 an enjoyable experience for all delegates, and cannot wait to meet everyone! Please do not hesitate to reach out to her for any questions at josephine.quon@smus.ca!!",

I began my Model United Nations journey in grade six and have loved the atmosphere of debate and fun ever since. Conference after conference, each experience brought new memories and opportunities for growth. I value all the fantastic moments I have shared with people from across Canada and beyond. I have learnt the importance of discourse, friendships, and standing up for yourself(or your country). I hope to offer those same opportunities to others through SMUSMUN. Outside of MUN, Manon can be found playing soccer and field hockey, seeing friends, or walking her dog. Manon is looking forward to meeting everyone and an exciting conference! ",

Despite having minimal experience with Model UN, he holds a variety of other passions. Namely, bowing down to the secretary general, admitting how much more superior she is, and recognizing his insufficiencies in every aspect when compared to Cindy Chen. Where he lacks experience in Model UN, he makes up for it in his professional pursuits. Dominic or 'Dommy Boy' (Yes, like the song Danny Boy) has spent large portions of his time running an underground forums for zoophiles. He hopes to form meaningful relationships with the delegates this iteration of SMUSMUN despite lacking one of his own.",
      "p2": "Currently a grade 9 student at St. Michael’s, Siena is super excited to be a page at this year’s SMUSMUN conference! So far, she’s only made it to one other conference—as the delegate of Qatar—mainly because she keeps forgetting to fill out the sign-up sheet (whoops). Despite her limited conference count, Siena has plenty of practice raising her placard, speaking, and diving into debate. With this experience, she’s looking forward to helping make SMUSMUN just as amazing for others as it was for her!",

Since starting MUN a year ago, Rachel has had a blast at every minute of her past three conferences. Her favorite part of MUN is the crisis, and in the past she has raised her placcard for countless bizarre motions, like adopting Kimism as the national religion of Montenegro to avoid a war with North Korea, or digging up volcanoes in Iceland to search for hidden nuclear bombs. When not in western business attire, Rachel can be found daydreaming about traveling, buying all the expansion packs of various board games, reading fantasy novels well past midnight, and, 99% of the time, rowing. Rachel can't wait to see what chaos SMUSMUN 2025 will bring!",
